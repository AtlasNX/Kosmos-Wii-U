  <short_description>Mocha Custom Firmware</short_description>
  <long_description>Mocha CFW is a custom firmware that is derived from iosuhax. It offers all the features of iosuhax and some addional features without the requirement of a fw.img on the SD card. Furthermore it combines all the current features of a custom firmware such as sysNAND or redNAND with signature patches into one application with a configuration setting.

Mocha CFW hooks itself into the IOS launch process, right before it jumps into the bootrom, and patches the (at this point) decrypted IOS ELF in memory with new functions.

New features

    fw.img less custom firmware
    sysNAND or redNAND patching in one application selected in a setting
    SEEPROM redirection to/from SD card
    OTP redirection from SD card
    custom launch image on load of the custom firmware if exist on sd card (sd:/wiiu/apps/mocha/launch_image.tga)
