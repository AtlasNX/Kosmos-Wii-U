You need to run haxchi/iosuhax/mocha cfw first in order for this homebrew to work.

This homebrew allows you to backup your Wii U and vWii savegames to the SD card and also restore them. Can also copy saves from NAND<->USB if title is installed to both. Up to 256 backups can be made per title. Backups are stored in sd:/wiiu/backups.</long_description>
